README:

To read our project, please open the following file:

Moon_T_project.ipynb

This is a merged copy of all of our models as well as the introductory scrapping and data exploration process.

Note: Please don't run any cell in the file, for all supporting materials are under the Supporting Materials folder.

Supporting Materials Folder

Like stated above, all supporting materials, including 5 notebooks which are merged into the final version of notebook, are contained in the notebook.
Each notebook can be run individually to validate the results of the final project.

In addition, if user really desires to run every cell inside Moon_T_project.ipynb, please copy the contents of Supporting Materials folder into the same directory as the Moon_T_project.ipynb file.
Then every single cell is executable.
